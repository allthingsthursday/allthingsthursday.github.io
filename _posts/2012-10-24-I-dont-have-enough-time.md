### I don't believe in time management.
By this, I am not saying that I don't believe that time management is
 a good idea, or even that I just don't believe that I will practice 
time management. I mean this in the same way that I don't believe in the
 tooth fairy or little purple men from Mars. I think that they are all 
figments of my imagination.

Managing can mean different things, but when we talk about "time 
management" I think it is apparent we are talking about managing a 
resource. The problem is that resource management is really all about 
regulating the speed of use or consumption of a resource in order to 
meet a larger goal. Time happens. Constantly. Consistently. No amount of
 "managing" it is going to change that fact, and I think the effort is, 
at the very least, a distraction from what we should truly be focusing 
on: value.

There are times, both in my professional life and in my personal 
life, where I am busy and times when I am less so. Regardless of how 
busy I am or am not, I don't think there is ever a moment where I don't 
have a long list of things I am doing, am interesting in doing, or at 
least *should* be doing (this one most likely varies depending on
 whether you are asking me or my wife...). In fact, on any given day that 
list would take up more time than I can imagine, and certainly more time
 than it would take for me to replace every item on the list several 
times over. I assume this is really true of everyone (or at least I hope
 so).

### So why do I feel busier some times than others?
Because sometimes I just want (or need) to get more done in the same 
amount of time. All the items on my list have one thing in common. They 
all have some amount of value to me. Some more, some less, but they all 
have at least some amount of value. This value helps us prioritize what 
needs to be done. Every moment, I am working on the most important thing
 on my list. Of course, how I determine what is the most important may 
change at any moment.

### So how does time fit into this anyway?
Time is one of the primary opposing forces to value. If something is 
of low value but will take very little time, it may be the better thing 
to tackle than the high-value, high-time item. In software engineering 
we make these decisions every day when determining scope or choosing the
 best solution for the problem at hand. When we make these decisions, we
 are assessing the value we will get (or provide) vs. the time we have 
to give.

Another way to think about this is this: every task on our mental 
to-do list has a maximum value. If this task was just magically done 
with no work or time investment, this is the value it would bring. Every
 moment we spend working on the task reduces its value. At some point, 
the time spent will completely negate the value, or even bring the task 
to a negative value. If we are still working on it at this point, there 
is a problem. (this does not take into account the value we gain by 
actually performing the work itself, such as learning value. That is a 
separate story...).

### What's your point anyway?
There is no such thing as time management. If you think you are doing
 it, you're not. You are (hopefully) doing value management.
