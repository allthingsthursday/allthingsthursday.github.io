title:  "Good idea/Bad idea"

As software engineers, we have ideas all the time. It's part of our job. 
A client has a problem, we must come up with ideas on how to solve it. 
One of the things that determines our success is how well our ideas 
address the problems they are meant to solve.  

Unfortunately, this is not always the easiest or most straightforward 
thing to determine. It is pretty rare that we will have *serious*
 ideas that fall all the way to either end of the good idea/bad idea 
spectrum (hey, let's just not worry about export control...). Instead, 
most ideas have some amount of tradeoff involved (we can add these 
features to the page, but it will make the page load slower).

The way we truly make a determination about an idea is by 
understanding all aspects of the proposed tradeoff and by understanding 
the priority of values involved in the problem. 

Sometimes the scope of a problem or idea is an internal issue, and 
the question can be answered by understanding the effect on issues like 
budget, schedule, code quality, codebase conventions, etc. 

In other cases, the way we solve a problem will have a direct impact 
on the end product, and the client or domain expert should have input as
 far as which values are most important in a proposed solution.

Regardless of what the scope of the problem is, keep the blinders 
off. Personally, I find it easy to get caught up in a specific idea and 
how great it is. Sometimes it takes the (hopefully constructive) 
criticism of another to show me the flaws in my ideas. When this 
happens, I may abandon my idea. Of course, I may still think my idea is 
good and proceed with it, but even in this case it is with a more 
complete view.
